# Automated Christmas Card Maker

Writing personalized Christmas cards can be a monotonous task. This application automates the process of writing personalized Christmas Cards. The application takes in an input of names in a "names.txt" file and creates a word document "ChristmasCard.docx" with a Christmas card tailored to the person's name! It continues creating personalized Christmas cards for all the names contained in the "names.txt" file.

This is a personal project made in Python using the python-docx framework.

Try it out for yourself!
